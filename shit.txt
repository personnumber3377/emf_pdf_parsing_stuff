2.3.4.1 EMR_EOF Record
The EMR_EOF record indicates the end of the metafile and specifies a palette.
Fields not specified in this section are specified in section 2.3.4.

Type (4 bytes): An unsigned integer that identifies this record type as EMR_EOF. This value is
0x0000000E.
nPalEntries (4 bytes): An unsigned integer that specifies the number of palette entries.
offPalEntries (4 bytes): An unsigned integer that specifies the offset to the palette entries from the
start of this record.
PaletteBuffer (variable, optional): An array of bytes that contains palette data, which is not
required to be contiguous with the fixed-length portion of the EMR_EOF record. Thus, fields in this
buffer that are labeled "UndefinedSpace" are optional and MUST be ignored.

PaletteEntries (variable): An array of LogPaletteEntry objects (section 2.2.18) that specifies the
palette data.
SizeLast (4 bytes): An unsigned integer that MUST be the same as Size and MUST be the last field
of the record and hence the metafile. LogPaletteEntry objects, if they exist, MUST precede this
field.

2.3.4.2 EMR_HEADER Record Types
The EMR_HEADER record is the starting point of an EMF metafile. It specifies properties of the
device on which the image in the metafile was recorded; this information in the header record makes
it possible for EMF metafiles to be independent of any specific output device.
The following are the EMR_HEADER record types.
Name Section Description
EmfMetafileHeader 2.3.4.2.1 The original EMF header record.
EmfMetafileHeaderExtension1 2.3.4.2.2 The header record defined in the first extension to EMF, which added
support for OpenGL records and an optional internal pixel format
descriptor.<62>
EmfMetafileHeaderExtension2 2.3.4.2.3 The header record defined in the second extension to EMF, which
added the capability of measuring display dimensions in
micrometers.<63>
EMF metafiles SHOULD be created with an EmfMetafileHeaderExtension2 header record.
The generic structure of EMR_HEADER records is specified as follows.
Fields not specified in this section are specified in section 2.3.4.
